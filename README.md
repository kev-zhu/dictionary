# Dictionary Web App

This dictionary web app was developed as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge to strengthen my foundational web development skills. I chose this assignment because it offered clear mockups and straightforward functionality, making it an ideal introduction to implementing real-world front-end features. The primary goal was to practice writing custom CSS and build a fully responsive layout across mobile and desktop screens, while also integrating core functionality like search and definition display using a dictionary API.

## Lessons

This project was one of my first hands-on experiences with API integration, and it helped me become comfortable handling asynchronous data in JavaScript. The most challenging aspect was learning how to style components correctly without relying on a framework. This process involved reviewing CSS documentation, experimenting with different layout strategies, and researching solutions via platforms and forums. I also learned how to apply media queries to build a responsive design that adjusts across screen sizes. Working without prebuilt tools gave me greater insight into how CSS works under the hood and helped build a stronger foundation for future frontend work.

## Technologies

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `Dictionary API`

## Features

Users can search for word definitions, phonetics, and pronunciations, all sourced dynamically from a public dictionary API. The app displays multiple entries for words, formatting the returned data to match the provided design. It also includes a dark mode toggle and fully responsive layout for both mobile and desktop views. As per the project requirements, all features were implemented without the help of CSS frameworks, using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
